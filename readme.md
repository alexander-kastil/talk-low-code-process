## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Microsoft 365 subscription with Copilot Studio access
- Azure subscription (for API deployments)
- .NET 9 SDK (for MCP servers and APIs)
- Node.js (for frontend applications)
- MCP Inspector: `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector`

### Running the Examples

#### No-Code Agents

Follow the instructions in [02-no-code](./02-no-code/) to create agents using Copilot Studio templates.

#### Low-Code Agents

Each low-code example in [03-low-code-agents](./03-low-code-agents/) contains detailed setup instructions.

#### MCP Servers

Navigate to the respective server directory and run:

```powershell
dotnet run
```

To test with MCP Inspector:

```powershell
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --config inspector.config.json --server <server-name>
```

#### Food Catalog API

```bash
cd src/food-catalog-api
