## Assets

Shared collateral used by agents and services. These are reference files to support demos and local development.

### Structure

- `agents/` – agent-specific assets used across the examples (logos, prompts, snippets).
- `images/` – screenshots and illustrations for docs and slides.
- `mcp/` – example Model Context Protocol (MCP) configurations and references for local Inspector use.
- `open-api/` – OpenAPI documents for HTTP-based tools and contract-first demos.
- `topics/` – canned topic files and small knowledge sources agents can reference.

Notes:

- Files here are intentionally lightweight; treat them as examples rather than a canonical source of truth.
- Subprojects may copy or link to these assets depending on their needs.
